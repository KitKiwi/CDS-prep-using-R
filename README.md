# CDS-prep-using-R
CDSSectionsBCDJ_20-21.Rmd is a R markdown file that takes California State University Enrollment Reporting System submission files and create numeric portions of Common Data Set Sections B, C, D, and J for 2020-2021.  Note that in Section B, graduation rates are not broken down by Stafford loan or Pell grant receipt status.  The codes were developed by using East Bay's data.  Other campuses may need modifications based on the specific student characteristics unique to the campus.  
The methodology used here is not necessarily a "correct" way to compute the statistics.  Rather, the file is meant to be an example of how R markdown document can ease the data entry by being able to produce html, word, or PDF output directly from the program.
Need COSAR table, included in this repository as commonc-cosarcipcodefxvw-prd-1.csv.  This file can also be downloaded from the Chancellor's Office's web site.  CIPCategory.csv, which was created from CDS form Section J, is also necessary to run the above R markdown file.
